<!-- Perhaps it would be better to just add the styling here, rather than referencing stylesheet(i'm sure there's some sort of loss in milliseconds).
However, inline styling has always been discouraged from any programmer i've ever spoken with,
hence the choice in creating the reusable component which references a stylesheet -->

export default {

  },
